# This script builds the stable pysmurf server docker image, which includes the firmware and
# configuration files, as well as pysmurf.
#
# The firmware and configuration files versions are defined in the 'definitions.sh' file, while the
# version of pysmurf is extracted from this copy of the repository (using the  `git describe --tags
# --always' command).
#
# This scripts downloads the firmware and configuration files into a temporal directory called
# 'local_files' which is then used by the Dockerfile to generate the final docker image.
# Finally, the docker image is pushed to Dockerhub, to the repository defined by the variables
# ${dockerhub_org_name} and ${dockerhub_repo_stable}.
#
# A 'base' pysmurf server image is not longer generated, but in order to be backward compatible
# with scripts that use that image, the same stable image is pushed to the Dockerhub repository
# defined by ${dockerhub_org_name} and ${dockerhub_repo_base} as well; this image can be used as
# base image as well, just like previous images. Finally, the docker images are tag with the same
# tag from this repository.
