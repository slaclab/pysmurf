# The SMuRF Packet

## Description

The SMuRF packet is formed by a header and a payload:

### SMuRF packet header

The header is 128-byte long and contains the following information:

#### Control Field (byte offset 104)

The bits in the control filed (byte offset 104) are:

|  bit  | Description
|-------|-------------------------------------------
|   0   | Clear average and unwrap
|   1   | Disable stream to MCE
|   2   | Disable file write
|   3   | Set to read configuration file each cycle
|  4-7  | Test mode:  0=normal, 1-15=test modes (see below)

The test mode selected by bits 4-7 are

| Mode   | Description
|--------|---------------------
|    0   | normal data
|    1   | All zeros for smurf data
|    2   | Smurf channels value = channel #
|    3   | smurf data channels toggle between -20000, and 20000 on syncword = multiple of 1000
|    4   | Each smurf channel independantly uniformly spaced random numbers, peak to peak 1000 (before filter)
|    5   | Sine waves, frequency = (param+1) * flux_ramp_rate / 2^16
|    6   |
|    7   |
|    8   | MCE output data all set to zero
|    9   | MCE output data = mce channel number
|   10   | MCE output ramps with syncbox signal * param
|   11   |

|   13   |
|   14   | Break checksum on 1/1000 mce frames
|   15   | Force framedrops  on 1/1000 mcde frames


### SMuRF packet payload

The payload contains signed 32-bit averaged data points. The number of points is defined in the header's `Number of channels of data` word.
