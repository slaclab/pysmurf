# Test scripts

## Description

Theses are a series of scripts that can be use to test certain functionality of the pysmurf core.

## Test scripts

### validate_filter.py

This script validates the behavior of the SmurfProcessor's filter.

The script creates a local root devices which contains an instance of the [SmurfProcessor](../../python/pysmurf/core/devices/_SmurfProcessor.py) device, connected to a [DataFromFile](../../python/pysmurf/core/emulators/_DataFromFile.py) data source, and it uses a [DataToFile](../../python/pysmurf/core/transmitters/_DataToFile.py) transmitter.

The scripts generates the filter parameters based on input arguments from the user (filter order and frequency) and set those parameters in the [SmurfProcessor](../../python/pysmurf/core/devices/_SmurfProcessor.py) device.

Then, the script generates random data, and send the data through the [SmurfProcessor](../../python/pysmurf/core/devices/_SmurfProcessor.py). The results are saved to disk. The same data is filtered using a `scipy.signal.butter` filter. Finally, both result are compared, calculating the RMSE between them. The test fails if the resulting RMSE is not `0`.

### validate_unwrapper.py

This script validates the behavior of the SmurfProcessor's unwrapper.

The script creates a local root devices which contains an instance of the [SmurfProcessor](../../python/pysmurf/core/devices/_SmurfProcessor.py) device, connected to a [DataFromFile](../../python/pysmurf/core/emulators/_DataFromFile.py) data source, and it uses a [DataToFile](../../python/pysmurf/core/transmitters/_DataToFile.py) transmitter.

The scripts perform two tests:
#### Unwrapper enabled

The script generates a `int32` sawtooth signal. From this signal, it generates a wrapped version, as `int16`. Then it send this wrapped version trough the [SmurfProcessor](../../python/pysmurf/core/devices/_SmurfProcessor.py). The results are saved to disk.

Finally, the script compares the original unwrapped signal to the result at the output of the [SmurfProcessor](../../python/pysmurf/core/devices/_SmurfProcessor.py), calculating the RMSE between them. The test fails if the resulting RMSE is not `0`.

#### Unwrapper disabled

In this test, the script disables the `Unwrapper` from the [SmurfProcessor](../../python/pysmurf/core/devices/_SmurfProcessor.py). Then, the script generates a wrapped version of a sawtooth signal, and sends it trough the [SmurfProcessor](../../python/pysmurf/core/devices/_SmurfProcessor.py). The results are saved to disk.

Finally, the script compares the original wrapped signal to the result at the output of the [SmurfProcessor](../../python/pysmurf/core/devices/_SmurfProcessor.py), calculating the RMSE between them. The test fails if the resulting RMSE is not `0`.

### profile_smurf_processor.py

This script can be used to profile different section of the [SmurfProcessor](../../src/smurf/core/processors/SmurfProcessor.cpp) C++ device. In order to get profile data, the SMuRF processor needs to be modified by adding `TimerWithStats` objects (available in [Timer.h](../../include/smurf/core/common/Timer.h)) in the appropriated places.

The script creates a local root devices which contains an instance of the [SmurfProcessor](../../python/pysmurf/core/devices/_SmurfProcessor.py) device, connected to a [StreamDataSource](../../python/pysmurf/core/emulators/_StreamDataSource.py) data source, and a [FrameStatistics](../../python/pysmurf/core/counters/_FrameStatistics.py) device. The script then enables the data source and let it send `100000` frames trough the [SmurfProcessor](../../python/pysmurf/core/devices/_SmurfProcessor.py).

### validate_base_tx.py

This scripts validates the behavior of the SmurfProcessor's BaseTransmitter.

The script creates a local root device which contains an instance of the [SmurfProcessor](../../python/pysmurf/core/devices/_SmurfProcessor.py) device, with a [BaseTransmitter](../../python/pysmurf/core/trasnmitters/_BaseTransmitter.py) attach to it, and connected to a [StreamDataSource](../../python/pysmurf/core/emulators/_StreamDataSource.py) data source. The script opens the `FileWriter`'s data file, disables the `Downsampler`, and enables the data source at a configurable rate (default = 500 Hz)and for a configurable time period (default = 30 s). At the end of the test, it verifies that all received frames where send successfully to the transmitter, without dropping frames through the data path. It also verify that frames we written to the output files, and that metadata frames where sent to the the transmitter as well.
