Writing a docstring
-------------------

pysmurf docstrings should be written in the NumPy style, and
documentation should be written in the reStructuredText (reST)
language.  See the `pandas docstring guide
<https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/development/contributing_docstring.html>`_
and the `numpydoc docstring guide
<https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html>`_ for a great
introduction to both the NumPy docstring style and reST markup, as
well as many examples.
