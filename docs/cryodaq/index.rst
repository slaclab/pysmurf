cryodaq
=======

Readout for cryogenic detector systems. What is here today is the client half:
connect to a server, read and write it by semantic name, and run the operations
its tree offers.

A **semantic name** means the same thing on every platform.
``band[0].tone.amplitude`` names the tone amplitude of band 0 wherever that
generation of firmware happens to keep it, and the platform layer turns the name
into the register path for the system actually connected. Register paths appear
only in :mod:`cryodaq.platform`; nothing above it builds one.

.. code-block:: python

   import cryodaq

   with cryodaq.connect('crate:4') as sess:
       sess.set('band[0].tone.amplitude', 0, index=17)
       sess.set('band[0].ops.gradient_descent.max_iters', 15)
       proc = sess.call('band[0].ops.start_gradient_descent')

Connecting needs rogue, which arrives with the SMuRF server image rather than
from a package index. It is imported by :func:`cryodaq.connect` and nowhere
else, so the package, the platform maps and the client-side bookkeeping work
anywhere Python does, and the rogue import fails where it is actually needed
rather than at import time.

The client is a thin layer over rogue's own client: a session holds one, and
``session.root`` is the server's tree, whole and unwrapped. What the client adds
is the stable name and the small amount of bookkeeping a client needs -- where
it writes, where it logs, what it publishes.

platform
--------

Which registers a system has, and where. A platform is identified by the
firmware image its FPGA reports, so a session resolves names against the map for
the hardware in front of it rather than against a configured guess.

This is the firmware/software boundary: a register path lives here or nowhere.
